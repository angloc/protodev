# Cline Rules for Protodev Development Environment

This project uses the protodev Docker development environment.

**Read .protodev/README.md to understand the development environment and follow its directions.**

The .protodev/README.md contains essential information about:
- Quick start guide for using the dev container
- Available tools and languages (Python, Node.js, Docker)
- Workflow options (VS Code Dev Containers, Docker Compose, Makefile)
- Port forwarding and Docker-in-Docker configuration
- Customisation options for your project
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Incorporating These Instructions

To ensure AI assistants working on this project can optimally utilize the development facilities, incorporate these rules into your project's `.clinerules` file. If you don't have a `.clinerules` file, you can rename this file to `.clinerules` and place it in your project root.
